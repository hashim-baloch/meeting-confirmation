# meeting-confirmation `--force`

Another generic project that, totally unpredictably, confirms meetings! But wait—this one minifies and crams its HTML into a QR code. Because scanning compressed markup is clearly the pinnacle of user experience.

## Overview

- A single, near-identical HTML page you can “conveniently” store in a data URL.
- Sublime, state-of-the-art glitchy styling that runs binary gibberish in the background.
- Absolutely impress your team by forcing them to chase a “Cancel” button that’s running away.

## Questionable Resources

## Why A QR Code?

- Because everyone loves taking their phones out to scan something.
- Because I like making questionable design decisions for fun.

## Usage

1.Just scan the QR code.(optional) 2. Lose faith in humanity’s priorities.(necessary)

## How It Works

- The HTML runs an amusing script that drops random 0s and 1s.
- “Cancel” is a game of tag; “Confirm” leads you to a nostalgic internet destination.
