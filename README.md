# meeting-confirmation `--force`

Another generic project that, totally unpredictably, confirms meetings! But wait—this one minifies and crams its HTML into a QR code. Because scanning compressed markup is clearly the pinnacle of user experience.

## Overview

- A single, highly compressed HTML page encoded within a QR code.
- Utilizes advanced minification techniques to reduce HTML size.
- Easily scan the QR code to access the compressed meeting confirmation page.

## Questionable Resources

## How It Works

- The entire HTML content is minified and compressed into a QR code.
- Scanning the QR code decompresses and renders the interactive meeting confirmation interface.
- “Cancel” is a game of tag; “Confirm” leads you to a nostalgic internet destination.
